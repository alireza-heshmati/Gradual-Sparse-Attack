# Gradual-Sparse-Attack

This repository is about how to design adversarial attack using Gradual Sparse Attack (GSA) algorithm.

Please see the results in GSA_scad for some random samples of ImageNet using the vits16 model. To adjust hyperparameters for other results, please refer to the [**paper**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107360) ("Fast adversarial attacks to deep neural networks through gradual sparsification") in Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Elsevier.
